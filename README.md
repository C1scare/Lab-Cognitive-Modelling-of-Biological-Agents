# Lab-Cognitive-Modelling-of-Biological-Agents

This project implements a modular maze environment for reinforcement learning, supporting various agent designs and a unified interface for training and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `maze/`: Environment logic and rendering
- `agents/`: Different agent policies
- `training/`: Scripts to train and test agents


## Getting Started
(optional, not necessary) To install the environment in a custom directory, add a prefix with the desired file path to the end of the .yml file.

```yml
prefix: C:\Users\user\anaconda3
```

Create the environment using the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f "PATH_TO_lab_env.yml"
```
